                                <h3>December Motivational Video</h3>
                                <p>I made this video as a way to express how I personally see December and the idea of
                                    endings in general. For many people, December feels like the final stop — the end of
                                    the year, the closing of unfinished goals, and sometimes even a reminder of time
                                    passing too quickly. I wanted to capture that feeling at first, which is why the
                                    video opens in a dimly lit room with the words “December is the end” written on the
                                    wall. The darkness reflects the heaviness that comes with the thought of closure.
                                    But I didn’t want to leave the message there. For me, December has always been more
                                    than an ending; it’s also the doorway to something new. That’s why I used the act of
                                    switching on the lamp as a turning point. When the warm light fills the room, the
                                    text changes to “December is just another chapter… not the end of your story.” This
                                    transformation represents a shift in mindset — from seeing life as a series of
                                    endings to seeing it as a continuous story with chapters that build on one another.

                                    The computer monitor, the desk, and the lamp are all simple, everyday objects, but
                                    that was intentional. I wanted to show that meaning doesn’t always come from grand
                                    things — even a small change, like turning on a lamp, can completely transform the
                                    mood of a space. Similarly, a change in perspective can completely transform how we
                                    see our own lives. The choice of warm yellow and green text adds to that feeling of
                                    renewal and positivity, almost like a handwritten reminder you might leave for
                                    yourself on a sticky note.

                                    For me, this video isn’t just about December; it’s about life in general. We often
                                    mistake an ending for a full stop, when really it’s just a comma in our story. By
                                    making this piece, I wanted to remind myself — and anyone watching — that every end
                                    is just a new beginning waiting to unfold. It’s about hope, resilience, and the
                                    belief that our stories don’t stop; they keep going, chapter by chapter.</p>
